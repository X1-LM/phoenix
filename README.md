Phoenix is a pseudointelligent psychotherapist chat-bot, created as a school project. It is a spiritual successor to the ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum.

This is written in Python and makes use of the random and regular expression libraries, So it should work on most systems without much hassle.
